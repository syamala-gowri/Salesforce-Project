The project to supply leftover food to poor people is an initiative that aims to tackle two major issues: food waste and hunger. The concept behind this project is simple yet impactfulâ€”collect surplus food from restaurants, grocery stores, catering services, and other food providers, and distribute it to underprivileged and impoverished communities through a well-coordinated system.
